Out of the 60 or so programs around the world,the most common are taxes and emission-trading programs. Broadly speaking,the former guarantees the carbon price and the latter delivers a guaranteed reduction in emissions.","marketType":["Voluntary markets","Compliance markets"],"organizationType":["policy makers","compliance market participants","low-carbon project developers","corporate credit buyers"],"level":"basic","order":1,"publish":true,"slug":"carbon-pricing-at-a-glance","href":"/basics/carbon-pricing-at-a-glance"},{"title":"Current state of carbon trading","description":"Governments have implemented over 30 compliance carbon markets around the world but few have prices high enough to drive decarbonization. Companies’ increasingly ambitious climate targets mean demand for carbon offsets has never been higher. But the voluntary carbon markets remain oversupplied.","level":"Basic","order":5,"publish":true,"slug":"current-status","href":"/basics/current-status"},{"title":"Goals and impact of carbon pricing","description":"A carbon price aims to ensure that the producers of greenhouse-gas emissions pay for the costs of such pollution. Such schemes have proved effective at reducing emissions,with social,economic and physical benefits.
