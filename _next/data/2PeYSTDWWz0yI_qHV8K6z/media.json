However, the ‘Fit for 55’ legislative package may shift the purpose and focus of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) to spotlight industrial emission reductions: benchmarks are tighter, free allocations lower and new sectors, like road transport and buildings, may be added. The European Commission has also unveiled its carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), which aims to protect EU industries from international competitors that do not pay a carbon price or equivalent. We will will look at the impact of the proposed reforms on industrials in particular and what we can expect if free allocations disappear.\n\nModerator:\nEmma Coker\nEmma Coker\nSenior Associate, EU Carbon, BloombergNEF\n\nPanelists:\nRob Barnett\nRob Barnett\nSenior Analyst, Bloomberg Intelligence\n\nMatt Gray (Remote)\nMatt Gray (Remote)\nCo-CEO and Co-founder, TransitionZero\n\nSanna O'Conner-Morberg\nSanna O'Conner-Morberg\nSenior Science Manager, Carbon Direct\n\nLiv Rathe (Remote)\nLiv Rathe (Remote)\nDirector, Norsk Hydro","thumbnail_url":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1441455482-b6d197fb5308923532289a169358e0413c97700345d96ff01497f228d2945977-d_295x166","thumbnail_width":295,"thumbnail_height":166,"thumbnail_url_with_play_button":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/filter/overlay?src0=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F1441455482-b6d197fb5308923532289a169358e0413c97700345d96ff01497f228d2945977-d_295x166&src1=http%3A%2F%2Ff.vimeocdn.com%2Fp%2Fimages%2Fcrawler_play.png","upload_date":"2022-05-30 04:43:34","video_id":715142990,"uri":"/videos/715142990","mediaCategory":"video-vimeo"},{"type":"video","version":"1.0","provider_name":"Vimeo","provider_url":"https://vimeo.com/","title":"BNEF Summit: Voluntary Carbon Markets - Boom, Bust, Boom?

Demand is on the rise and in record territory for the fifth consecutive year as the corporate race to net-zero accelerates. If demand continues to surge, BNEF forecasts that prices could increase fifty-fold by 2050. Suppliers are seeing these demand signals, ramping up offset creation in sectors ranging from direct air capture to reforestation. What are the market's shortfalls, even as it surges?

Across the Atlantic, France has successfully advocated for an EU carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), which is expected to be implemented in 2023.  The EU has also sought to build bridges with the Biden administration in creating an anti-dumping climate club that may conflict with the G7’s Industrial Decarbonization Agenda and even its own CBAM scheme.  The result of this low-level power and intellectual struggle will likely affect the cost of trade, particularly for goods deemed carbon-intensive and trade-exposed, and reshape international markets for sectors like steel and aluminum.

For many of these companies, carbon offsets are an essential transitional tool to address these residual emissions until more effective decarbonization options become available. For others, offsets are a fig leaf that distracts from instituting actual change. As the carbon offset market matures and works out some of its growing pains, transport companies in both of these buckets will need to confront a new reality. What are the current shortfalls of the offset market? How do changes in offset prices impact decarbonization strategies in the transport sector?
