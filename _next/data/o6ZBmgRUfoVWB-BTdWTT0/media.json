Expectations for new guidelines and policies in the upcoming compliance cycle raise questions about potential changes, particularly regarding whether there will be distinct benchmarks for emission allowance issuances in different years.

Should we convince African nations to keep their oil in the ground instead of extracting it and reaping the economic benefits? Where should Europe source its liquefied natural gas from? Would financing LNG in Africa be consistent with energy transition financing?

The market is oversupplied with a glut of energy and nature-based credits, some of which have been revealed to be low quality. As a result, while companies continue to buy carbon offsets to meet their emission reduction targets, they are faced with scrutiny about the quality of those credits. Recently, companies are signing multi-million-dollar deals for technology-based removal credits. Should the market abandon all existing credits and focus exclusively on new technology-based removal solutions?

Across the Atlantic, France has successfully advocated for an EU carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), which is expected to be implemented in 2023.  The EU has also sought to build bridges with the Biden administration in creating an anti-dumping climate club that may conflict with the G7’s Industrial Decarbonization Agenda and even its own CBAM scheme.  The result of this low-level power and intellectual struggle will likely affect the cost of trade, particularly for goods deemed carbon-intensive and trade-exposed, and reshape international markets for sectors like steel and aluminum.

For many of these companies, carbon offsets are an essential transitional tool to address these residual emissions until more effective decarbonization options become available. For others, offsets are a fig leaf that distracts from instituting actual change. As the carbon offset market matures and works out some of its growing pains, transport companies in both of these buckets will need to confront a new reality. What are the current shortfalls of the offset market? How do changes in offset prices impact decarbonization strategies in the transport sector? What technologies are needed to further boost the market?\n\nChelsea Bryant\nManaging Director, Radicle\n\nJuan Moran\nGlobal Customer Director, DHL\n\nStephanie Zhu\nGeneral Manager, Sustainability, Delta\n \nModerator:\n\nKyle Harrison\nHead of Corporate Sustainability Research, BloombergNEF","thumbnail_url":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1369565554-caf87cf9051c58af3a3d30ff71214899bac3d8e22024de59ec30799b1124577c-d_640","thumbnail_width":640,"thumbnail_height":360,"thumbnail_url_with_play_button":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/filter/overlay?src0=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F1369565554-caf87cf9051c58af3a3d30ff71214899bac3d8e22024de59ec30799b1124577c-d_640&src1=http%3A%2F%2Ff.vimeocdn.com%2Fp%2Fimages%2Fcrawler_play.png","upload_date":"2022-02-10 06:12:57","video_id":675837614,"uri":"/videos/675837614","mediaCategory":"video-vimeo"},{"type":"video","version":"1.0","provider_name":"Vimeo","provider_url":"https://vimeo.com/","title":"Can We Offset Our Way to Net-Zero?: BNEF","author_name":"BloombergNEF","author_url":"https://vimeo.com/bnef","is_plus":"0","account_type":"business","html":"<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/673722066?app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\" title=\"Can We Offset Our Way to Net-Zero?: BNEF\"></iframe>","width":640,"height":360,"duration":1129,"description":"","thumbnail_url":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1365266546-8de9005fd1f1c375f889eb9a918e159a58202268519e51faedafbd383097f53c-d_640","thumbnail_width":640,"thumbnail_height":360,"thumbnail_url_with_play_button":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/filter/overlay?src0=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F1365266546-8de9005fd1f1c375f889eb9a918e159a58202268519e51faedafbd383097f53c-d_640&src1=http%3A%2F%2Ff.vimeocdn.com%2Fp%2Fimages%2Fcrawler_play.png","upload_date":"2022-02-04 14:30:09","video_id":673722066,"uri":"/videos/673722066","mediaCategory":"video-vimeo"},{"type":"video","version":"1.0","provider_name":"Vimeo","provider_url":"https://vimeo.com/","title":"BNEF Talk: Carbon Market - Connecting the Dots","author_name":"BloombergNEF","author_url":"https://vimeo.com/bnef","is_plus":"0","account_type":"business","html":"<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/652884735?app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\" title=\"BNEF Talk: Carbon Market - Connecting the Dots\"></iframe>","width":640,"height":360,"duration":576,"description":"BNEF Summit Shanghai, November 30-December 1, 2021\n\n\nBo Qin\nLead Analyst, European Carbon, BloombergNEF","thumbnail_url":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1317448922-4df938c9f24433edacc2eb9503bd388b47990ed2358f960a43c81bbe84bea7f0-d_640","thumbnail_width":640,"thumbnail_height":360,"thumbnail_url_with_play_button":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/filter/overlay?src0=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F1317448922-4df938c9f24433edacc2eb9503bd388b47990ed2358f960a43c81bbe84bea7f0-d_640&src1=http%3A%2F%2Ff.vimeocdn.com%2Fp%2Fimages%2Fcrawler_play.png","upload_date":"2021-12-03 08:48:31","video_id":652884735,"uri":"/videos/652884735","mediaCategory":"video-vimeo"},{"id":"1","url":"https://open.spotify.com/episode/3YC9bpBUAdjvFcAJOoKZI4?si=00d720deb86c4491","mediaCategory":"audio-spotify"},{"id":"22","url":"https://open.spotify.com/episode/2uMIfiPiy20TgxToFeeAVz?si=19429f8f83554269","mediaCategory":"audio-spotify"},{"id":"23","url":"https://open.spotify.com/episode/5NJL5skDDiHzkyIVAWMi1P?si=1d6658950b93427b","mediaCategory":"audio-spotify"},{"id":"24","url":"https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ka19EzgVe2PhvmQYh55bE?si=8781548c82b146e5","mediaCategory":"audio-spotify"},{"id":"24","url":"https://open.spotify.com/episode/1xwm87MltT3dMOjXK8fCD7?si=fd9c0bbdc7e14753","mediaCategory":"audio-spotify"},{"id":"25","url":"https://open.spotify.com/episode/6djRATdjrPqUpFvS1SXUEt?si=ffd3852b4b984013","mediaCategory":"audio-spotify"},{"id":"27","url":"https://open.spotify.com/show/5P3uXhpfC8kSLVCRRkgGnj","mediaCategory":"audio-spotify"},{"id":"35","url":"https://open.spotify.com/episode/3n1gVY2W7mGTVwb47DsS81?si=0h0AURWHRpWH1zBGsBACAg","mediaCategory":"audio-spotify"},{"id":"36","url":"https://open.spotify.com/episode/4FEY5i0HsQdY9OfQzVQBdN?si=Pxdvo5A_R9ygtyNsg3Ch4A","mediaCategory":"audio-spotify"},{"id":"37","url":"https://open.spotify.com/episode/1xwm87MltT3dMOjXK8fCD7?si=UYDgEUJNTXydgX44QIOXdg","mediaCategory":"audio-spotify"},{"id":"38","url":"https://open.spotify.com/episode/0HrXdGz5mDHE2DrtJLhVKh?si=AmrZ3tgpTJ-oVJzgKgNBdw","mediaCategory":"audio-spotify"},{"id":"39","url":"https://open.spotify.com/episode/2nKFKu3j8k9IrZSuefATOp?si=zIX1FBX1TQa3VQKLarsbDA","mediaCategory":"audio-spotify"},{"id":"40","url":"https://open.spotify.com/episode/2zPZPktysjOQFD3TIDxbSZ?si=0271bf0ddcb547f6","mediaCategory":"audio-spotify"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
