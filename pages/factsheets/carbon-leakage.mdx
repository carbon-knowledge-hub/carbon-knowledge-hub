# Carbon leakage and import tariffs

Putting a price on greenhouse gas emissions runs the risk of “carbon leakage”, which occurs when companies move production to markets with less onerous environmental regulations. Governments seek to avoid carbon leakage through free allocation, tax-free allowances, and exemptions. But such measures mean that companies are not as incentivized to cut their emissions, running counter to climate targets. As a result, some governments are considering whether to put a carbon price on imported goods.

<KeyMessage>
  A great number of compliance carbon markets and taxes, with rising prices, increases the risk
  of carbon leakage. Governments have sought to mitigate this risk by offering
  concessions – such as free carbon permits or tax-free allowances – to
  companies exposed to international competition. These weaken the effectiveness
  of the carbon price, spurring some policy makers to consider imposing a carbon
  tariff on imported goods.

## Carbon leakage

Climate policies such as carbon pricing impose costs on companies to spur decarbonization. This increases the risk that domestic companies relocate to countries where they would face lower environmental costs. Such a move would shift those companies’ carbon emissions offshore, weakening the impact of the carbon price and reducing the original country’s economic competitiveness. Governments with a carbon price have sought to mitigate this risk in various ways. In some carbon markets, such as China’s emissions trading programs, participants receive a share of their emission allowances as free allocation, while some taxes, like those in Canada and South Africa, include exemptions or reduced tariffs for certain sectors.

In the EU Emissions Trading System, the European Commission has devised a list of sectors at significant risk of carbon leakage. The amount of free allocation for each participant is calculated based on production quantity and a benchmark value for that product in terms of emissions per metric ton. The EU has been steadily decreasing the volume of free allocation, and sectors less exposed to carbon leakage will see free allocation phased out after 2026, from a maximum of 30% to zero by 2030.

## Import tariffs

Governments around the world are starting to consider emissions linked to imported goods. Markets like the EU, Japan and US have much higher emissions embedded in imports than those produced domestically. This has raised the question of carbon import tariffs, and the EU has the most advanced scheme which began the transitional phase in 2023. Its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) places a price on the emissions generated during the production process for carbon-intensive goods that are imported into the EU. More information on import tariffs and the EU's CBAM could be found in the factsheet on carbon border tariffs.
