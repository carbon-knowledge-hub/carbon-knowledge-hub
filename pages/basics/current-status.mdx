# Current state of carbon trading

Global carbon markets have grown exponentially in the last few years. Governments’ increasingly ambitious climate targets have led to new compliance emission-trading schemes and higher prices in existing carbon markets. The voluntary markets have also seen a surge in demand on the back of bold corporate sustainability pledges. But supply has failed to keep up, leaving the markets overflowing with cheap, low-quality offsets because of poor oversight.

  Governments have implemented about 33 compliance carbon markets around the
  world, with 14 others under development and eight under consideration. But few have prices high enough to drive decarbonization. Meanwhile,
  companies’ increasingly ambitious climate targets mean demand for carbon
  offsets has never been higher. But the voluntary carbon markets remain
  oversupplied.

## Compliance markets

A growing number of countries with decarbonization ambitions have introduced compliance carbon markets as a more politically palatable option than carbon taxes. More than 30 such programs are in force, covering about 18% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. In 2023, compliance carbon markets generated a revenue of almost $74 billion.

These compliance markets are growing rapidly in terms of traded value as a result of the rising price per unit of emissions traded. The growth can be attributed to the emission trading schemes implemented by various countries and regions globally. According to LSEG, the EU ETS, which currently makes up about 87% of the global carbon market, increased by about 2% from 2022. Its total worth is about €770 billion as of 2023. ETS will continue to play a vital role in creating economic incentives for reductions in emissions and driving the transition to a low-carbon economy.

However, most of global emissions are not covered by a carbon price at or above the estimated range required to limit global warming to 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. This range of prices was estimated to be $63-127 per ton of CO2-equivalent by 2030, as recommended by the World Bank's High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices. However, about two-thirds of the emissions are covered under ETS that have an average price of $10 in 2023.

Compliance carbon markets tend to focus on certain sectors, with power generation and industry being the most common. These typically comprise a limited number of emission-intensive companies, thereby reducing the administrative burden for regulators. However, as the power sector is decarbonized through renewables, governments are increasingly looking to expand compliance carbon markets to other sectors – such as transport, buildings, or agriculture – which have many point sources but make up an increasing share of emissions.

Moreover, seven major compliance carbon markets around the world now allow the use of [offsets](/factsheets/offsets-in-compliance-programs) in some form, such as stipulations for locally generated carbon offsets, and a limit for the proportion of offsets allowed to be used toward compliance obligations. Compliance markets such as the EU ETS and New Zealand used to permit companies to use offsets generated under the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation for compliance, but stopped doing so after the vast availability of offsets contributed to an oversupply in the market, causing prices to crash.

## Voluntary markets

Alongside governments’ climate goals, corporate net-zero targets have created soaring [demand for offsets](factsheets/voluntary-offset-demand) in voluntary carbon markets. In 2023, companies retired 164 million credits, surpassing the previous record set in 2021 by about 2%. But supply still outstrips demand, and this will likely continue to 2050.

The price of voluntary carbon offsets varies by country and sector, averaging under $9 per ton by sector in 2023. The main drivers are the sector of the project and its additionality – whether decarbonization would not have happened without offset revenue. Offsets from energy generation projects are the cheapest as they typically have low additionality. For example, renewable build in most of the world (except least-developed countries) is economically feasible without additional support. Offsets from projects that protect, manage sustainably or restore natural ecosystems are among the most expensive as they rank highly on the additionality spectrum. A project’s location and age, or vintage, also impact offset prices.

The most common [offset sectors](/factsheets/voluntary-offset-supply) include nature-based solutions (including avoided deforestation and reforestation), energy generation and projects that capture fugitive emissions. Energy generation made up 41% of offsets retired on various registries, including Verra, Gold Standard, Climate Action Reserve, and American Carbon Registry.

Asia Pacific, Latin America and Africa continue to be the main regions issuing carbon credits, making up about 79% of total carbon offsets issued in 2023.

[Article 6 of the Paris Agreement](factsheets/article-6) established various tools to enable countries and companies to achieve their climate goals via collaboration on global carbon trading – namely Article 6.2, which allows parties to cooperate using internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs), and Article 6.4, which established a global offset market similar to the Clean Development Mechanism. While Article 6 could help scale up and standardize offset markets, its exact implementation is still being determined and could take months or years.
